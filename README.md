# Web Components A11y
I'm experimenting with web components for building accessible custom elements. I
like the closer-to-the-metal experience than frameworks like
[React](https://reactjs.org) or [Angular](https://angular.io).
Now let the record show, I am a big fan of React. This project is exploring ways
to build components that have interop with multiple frameworks and systems.

I am using the [open-wc](https://open-wc.org) generator to scaffold my
components quickly and accurately. Eventually I will add
[Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) to the mix. Once I learn how to write
it. :)

I have also recently learned about the [Modern Web](https://modern-web.dev/) site. I recommend that one too.

## Inspiration and guides
I think this repository will grow into a full-blown design system. I know, it doesn't seem like it just now, but that's the want. I am a React dev, but I spend a lot of time looking at Next, Svelte, Solid, and vanilla JS. The idea of having components I can use across libraries is appealing. If I can write it once and use it everywhere, that's less time doing boring things and more time doing interesting ones. As such, this section will house blog posts, links, and inspirations for moving toward that goal.

## Testing
I'm a big believer in testing. I prefer to write them often, and include a11y tests at every level (unit, integration, e2e).
