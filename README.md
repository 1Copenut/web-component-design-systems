# Web Components A11y
I'm experimenting with web components for building accessible custom elements. I
like the closer-to-the-metal experience than frameworks like
[React](https://reactjs.org) or Angular.
Now let the record show, I am a big fan of React. This project is exploring ways
to build components that have interop with multiple frameworks and systems.

I am using the [open-wc](https://open-wc.org) generator to scaffold my
components quickly and accurately. Eventually I will add
[Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) to the mix. Once I learn how to write
it. :)
